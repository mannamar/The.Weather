# WeatherApp
  
Azure Deployment: https://mannaweatherapp.azurewebsites.net/
  
A fully functional Weather App that pulls data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It shows the current weather info as well as forecasts for the day and week  
  
Results favor US cities but international codes are supported. For example, searching for 'Paris' outputs the result for Paris, Texas but searching for 'Paris, FR' will get you Paris, France  
  
Some more examples:  
Lodi --> Lodi, California  
Lodi, IT --> Lodi, Italy  
Madrid --> Madrid, Iowa  
Madrid, ES --> Madrid, Spain  
  
If no suitable US City is found, the top international result will be shown. For example 'Beijing' results in Beijing, China without needing the country code  
  
Some examples:  
Nairobi -- > Nairobi, Kenya  
London --> London, Great Britain  
Amsterdam --> Amsterdam, Netherlands
